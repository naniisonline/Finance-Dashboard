## Financial Sales Dashboard using Power BI
This dashboard was developed using Power BI's built-in finance dataset. It is present in the help section in ribbon. It provides a comprehensive view of key financial metrics across various segments, time periods, and product categories.

### Key Features:
- **Overall Sales Insights:** Displays key figures such as total sales, profit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and units sold.
- **Sales by Discount Band:** A pie chart segmenting sales data by discount levels (Medium, High, Low, None) to assess discount performance.
- **Sales by Segment:** Highlights sales distribution across business segments such as Government, Small Business, Enterprise, and Channel Partners.
- **Monthly Sales Trends:** A line chart illustrating monthly sales trends for a given year, helping identify seasonal fluctuations.
- **Country Filter:** A slicer enabling the user to filter sales data by country (Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, United States).

Same is done for profit and Units sold data. I have linked the .pbix format of the file here you can check it out by downloading it.
### Purpose:
This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing sales performance over time and across multiple dimensions, helping decision-makers identify trends, key performance areas, and opportunities for improvement.
